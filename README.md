##How to Play
*To play this game open index.html in a web browser.
*Use the Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys to control the player.
*Avoid the ladybugs and reach the water to score.
*If the player collides with a ladybug he will lose a heart and get sent back to where he started.
*When the player runs out of hearts/lives the game ends.
	*The player is prompted whether or not he wishes to continue playing
	*The game is reset (score and hearts/lives) when the player presses SPACE

	*Number of ladybugs can be changed with the 'enemyNum' integer
	*Number of player lives cn be changed with the 'heartNum' integer
	*Ladybug speed range can be changed with 'enemySpeed' array
